Hope Diagnostics is an online symptom checker web application designed and built 
by Segun Ayodele as the second milestone project at Code Institute. Hope Diagnostics 
is primarily for patients who cannot access the regular medical services because of 
remoteness or social distancing as the case is during the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak.
Through entered symptoms into the web app, Hope Diagnostics returns possible diseases 
the patient may be suffering from.
Furthermore, Hope Diagnostics also provides its users the service of scheduling call 
sessions with doctors for medical advice.

## UX
### Users Goal
* To access medical diagnosis services remotely.
* To help decide if symptoms are worth visiting the hospital for.
* To schedule a call session with Hope Diagnostics doctors for medical advice.

### Business Goal
* To provide instant medical diagnostic services to patients remotely located 
   or cannot visit an hopital for some other reasons.
* To provide quick and accesssible medical advice through call sessions with

   the pressure on the health care system.

### User Story
#### Persona

restuarant.
Andriana has been mildly symptomatic and she resumes her next shift at work in 24 
hours. As a Hope Diagnostics user I want/need/expect to:
* Carry out diagnosis on my symptoms to know the severity of my condition there by informing my next line of action such as visit the hospital or self-isolate.
* Find out the illness my symtoms are related to.
* Schedule a call session with Hope Diagnostics doctors for cross examination and advice.

She wants to find out if her symptoms are stress related or something serious
