Hope Diagnostics is an online symptom checker web application designed and built 
by Segun Ayodele as the second milestone project at Code Institute. Hope Diagnostics 
is primarily for patients who cannot access the regular medical services because of 
remoteness or social distancing as the case is during the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak.
Through entered symptoms into the web app, Hope Diagnostics returns possible diseases 
the patient may be suffering from.
Furthermore, Hope Diagnostics also provides its users the service of scheduling call 
sessions with doctors for medical advice.
